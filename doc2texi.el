;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I suppose the most immediate question to ask is "Why do this in
;; emacs lisp???"  While it is true that the gnuplot.doc file lends
;; itself to processing by a 1 pass filter, there are some aspects of
;; texinfo files that are a bit tricky and would require 2 or perhaps
;; three passes.  Specifically, getting all of the cross references
;; made correctly is a lot of work.  Fortunately, texinfo-mode has
;; functions for building menus and updating nodes.  This saves a lot
;; of sweat and is the principle reason why I decided to write this in
;; emacs lisp.
;;
;; Everything else in gnuplot is written in C for the sake of
;; portability.  Emacs lisp, of course, requires that you have emacs.
;; For many gnuplot users, that is not a good assumption.  However,
;; the likelihood of needing info files in the absence of emacs is
;; very, very slim.  I think it is safe to say that someone who needs
;; info files has emacs installed and thus will be able to use this
;; program.
;;
;; Since this is emacs, I am not treating the gnuplot.doc file as a
;; text stream.  It seems much more efficient in this context to treat
;; it as a buffer.  All of the work is done by the function
;; `d2t-doc-to-texi'.  Each of the conversion chores is handled by an
;; individual function.  Each of these functions is very similar in
;; structure.  They start at the top of the buffer, search forward for
;; a line matching the text element being converted, perform the
;; replacement in place, and move on until the end of the buffer.
;; These text manipulations are actually quite speedy.  The slow part
;; of the process is using the texinfo-mode function to update the
;; nodes and menus.  However, using these slow functions has one
;; advantage -- the texinfo-mode functions for doing menus and nodes
;; are certain to do the job correctly.  Although rather slow, this
;; approach doesn't totally suck compared to the time cost of
;; compiling and running a C program.  And the output from this is
;; much more useful than the output from the doc2info program.
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; Use:
;;
;; Customize the variables at the start of the executable code.  Then
;; I intend that this be used from the command line or from a Makefile
;; like so:
;;
;;      emacs -batch -l doc2texi.el -f d2t-doc-to-texi
;;
;; or
;;
;;      emacs -batch -l doc2texi.el -f d2t-doc-to-texi-verbosely
;;
;; This will start emacs in batch mode, load this file, run the
;; converter, then quit.  This takes about 30 seconds my 133 MHz
;; Pentium.  It also sends a large number of messages to stderr, so you
;; may want to redirect stderr to /dev/null or to a file.
;;
;; Then you can do
;;
;;      makeinfo gnuplot.info
;;
;; You may want to use the --no-split option.

;;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; Lars Hecking asked me to look into the doc -> info problem.  Silly
;; me, I said "ok."  This is what I came up with.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; To do:
;;
;;  -- internal cross-references: these are not perfect due to
;;     inconsistencies in the use of `` and case inconsistencies in
;;     the text.  The latter can be fixed.  Also I need a way to not
;;     make the @ref if point is currently in that region.
;;  -- catch errors gracefully, particularly when looking for files.
;;  -- are guesses about OS specific terminal information correct?
;;  -- turn the lists in the "What's New" and "xlabel" sections into
;;     proper lists.  "^\\([0-9]\\)+\." finds the list items.  If
;;     (match-string 1) is "1" then insert "@enumerate\n@item\n", else
;;     insert "@item\n".  also use (replace-match "").  need to find
;;     the end somehow.
