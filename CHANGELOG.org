* Version 0.6.0 (2011-12-13)

- Changed numbering scheme to accommodate gnuplot packaging
  requirements.
- Moved to github, updated contact info.

* Version 0.5.0 (2002-09-16)

- Wrote initial draft of gnuplot-gui.el, included it in insertions
  menu and in =gnuplot-insert=. Negate option function, bound to =C-c
  C-n=.
- =C-c C-h= with no response goes to Commands menu. Transparent toolbar
  icons. Replace kw-compl with a simple completion function. Put
  gnuplot-toolbar code in gnuplot.el.
- Send file uses the load command. add =gnuplot-plot-from-comint= and
  =gnuplot-save-and-plot-from-comint= and keybindings in the comint
  buffer. do =(process-kill-without-query gnuplot-process nil)=.
  =gnuplot-negate-option= checks if set option has a negated form.
- =gnuplot-kill-gnuplot-buffer= made more robust. fixed a bug in
  =gnuplot-plot-from-comint=. fixed description of gnuplot-faces
  group.
- Update copyright information, update gpelcard
- Change installation materials. Add some support for hidden3d. Use
  constants in types alists in gui. Various other minor improvements
  to the types alists.
- Removed =gnuplot-which-highlight= variable and revamped how
  colorization gets turned on. This is a bit tricky since I want it to
  work with font-lock under emacs and xemacs and with hilit19.
- Insert space at end of unique completion. add a few GUI types,
  rewrite some stuff in the GUI interface. primitive support for plot,
  splot, and fit. Fixed completion in file widget.
- Add =pgnuplot.c= and Win9x install instructions to the distribution.
  Fixed a defface bug. Added =gnuplot-keywords-when= allowing deferral
  of parsing the info file.
- Fixed font-locking of strings and comments. Figure out
  =gnuplot-version= number from startup message and set
  =gnuplot-echo-command-line-flag= accordingly. Added
  =gnuplot-program-version= variable. Check that font-lock is actually
  a feature.
- Added =gnuplot-determine-gnuplot-version= so that the gnuplot
  version number and =comint-process-echos= actually get set
  correctly. Actually, the first time something is plotted, the
  echoing might not work, but the second time it will.
- Once again changed how =comint-process-echos= gets set. Maybe I got
  it right this time? Also fixed certain situations where the info
  file did notget properly loaded (insertion with info toggle on and
  info button in GUI).
- Do a more robust check for the gnuplot process before killing the
  gnuplot buffer.
- Make =gnuplot-send-line-and-forward= skip over blank and comment
  lines.
- Bound =C-c C-j= to =gnuplot-forward-script-line=.
- Support for pm3d in gnuplot-gui and in plot options insertions menu.
  mentioned pm3d in gpelcard. gui support for x11 pm3d and vgagl
  terms. =gnuplot-negate-option= works with new syntax.
- Add colorization and gui support for new commands in 3.8. gui
  support for emf term. gui support for new "set style" syntax. much
  better scheme for determining gnuplot version number + make better
  use of it.
- Corrected a serious problem interacting with speedbar
- Fixed problem with toolbar creation and speedbar clicking
- Added font-lock bindings for words associated with plotting
- Bind =C-c C-c= to =comment-region= and =C-c C-o= to the GUI, also
  make =C-c C-l= respect continuation lines. Added feature to trim
  length of gnuplot process buffer.
- Yet again changed how =comint-process-echos= gets set. It really
  needs to be nil on NTEmacs 21.1 or comint gets stuck in an infinate
  loop.
- Fixed a problem with =C-c C-v= jumping forward 2 lines at a time

* Version 0.4.0 (1998-12-14)

- Use info-look for info interface. No change to gnuplot-mode user
  interface, but cleaner code. With info-look, the help funcion works
  regardless of the version number of gnuplot. Also,
  =gnuplot-keywords= (used for help, keyword-completion, and hilit19
  highlighting) is now generated automatically.
- =info-look= leaves a couple of really useless buffers lying around
  so I cleaned them up. Also fixed font-lock rules so that things in
  quotes get highlighted correctly and the surrounding text is
  unhighlighted. Fixed up font-lock rules for plot and splot. Added
  =gnuplot-send-line-and-forward=.
- Added toolbar for xemacs -- see file =gnuplot-toolbar.el=. Fixed
  error message in plot line function when line is empty. Option added
  to display the comint buffer showing the gnuplot process in a
  separate frame
- Fixed highlighting in comint buffer. fixed frame behavior. added
  "[:]" to range insertions. added :link to defgroup.
- Fixed some mismatched defcustoms. added a few lines to suppress some
  compile-time warnings.
- Fixed behavior of filename insertion function. Added more :links to
  defgroup.
- Added function =gnuplot-setup-info-look= and variable
  =gnuplot-info-hook= to handle various versions of the gnuplot info
  file.
- Split up gnuplot-insertions-menu for ease of custimization, put
  menubar initialization in a function.
- defcustom the insertions submenus, add
  =gnuplot-insertion-menu-flag=, intelligent Makefile knows which
  info-look to compile

* Version 0.3.0 (1998-09-15)

- Include insertions menu.
- Fixed bug finding info file if missing, fixed bug starting
  font-lock, fixed bug re overwriting files in installation script.
- Added =(require info)= to =eval-and-compile= clause, Added
  =(kill-all-local-variables)= to =gnuplot-mode=, altered order of:
  =(provide gnuplot)= =(run-hooks gnuplot-load-hook)= at the end of
  the file in case something in the load hook requires gnuplot (oh not
  that old one again...), added =gnuplot-comint-setup-hook=, corrected
  =gnuplot-mark-active= which caused an error to be raised by (mark)
  when the mark was inactive. Some changes to font-lock rules.

* Version 0.2.0 (1998-09-11)

- Added filename insertion, indentation, and colorization/completion
  in comint buffer.
- Made =indent-line-function= buffer-local (whoops!) and fixed some
  stuff in the installation script

* Version 0.1.0 (1998-06-25)

- Finished with initial release.
